## Code Review

Today we'll take 45 minutes or so to review the core technical challenge of yesterday's lab: the addition of the sixth and seventh questions to the guessing game on the About Me project.

## Look at the lab assignment, including PAIR PROGRAMMING

Here's the basics of what you need to know about *pair programming*. This is a methodology for work in software development that is increasingly more popular and widespread (not only in development work, but also in interview processes), and we place a high value on training our students to pair program effectively. There's more details in the lab assignment.

- In pair programming there are two developers working on a single body of code on a single computer.
- One member of the pair is the Driver, and this person will be the one doing all of the actual typing work on the laptop.
- The other member of the pair is the Navigator, and this person will work with only their voice and their thoughts.
- The Navigator does not touch the keyboard, nor does the Navigator work on their laptop "on the side". The Navigator is fully engaged with the work that the pair is doing, typically using at most a piece of scratch paper to sketch diagrams, take notes, or list ideas.
- Again, **the Navigator does not touch the keyboard**, nor does the Navigator work on code on their laptop "on the side"... at most the Navigator uses their laptop to perhaps keep a copy of this assignment document open or to look up something needed to write the code, such as a reference page like MDN.
- Under no circumstances does the Navigator work on any code on their laptop: for the pair programming process to be effective, both parties must be fully engaged on the code they're working on together.

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Day 4 of Code 201, students will:

- Demonstrate understanding of how functions work in JavaScript, as well as the component pieces including declarations, calls, parameters, arguments, and returns, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of CSS layout principles including block, inline, normal, relative, absolute, float, and fixed, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Be able to successfully pair program with a fellow student and manage the collaborative and version control aspects of working with Git (from the command line) and GitHub (in the browser), as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment.
