For your final project, your task is to work with a team to build a website that simulates a real-world product, service, or game.

## Guidelines

Your team must adhere to the following requirements:

- Each person must make meaningful contributions in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Your website must have at least 3 interlinked pages (one of which is an "About the Team" page of some kind) and clear navigation between the pages.
- Your website must have at least 2 pages that accept and process user input.
- Your website's state must persist between page reloads.
- Your website must be deployed live on the Internet at the time of project presentations on Friday, and your presentation should utilize this deployment.
- You will have a daily individual project report to submit via Canvas.
- Your team will do a standup meeting every morning with the instructional team (or some subset thereof)

## Process

Here's the process that we'll be using for project week:

- On the first day of project week, your team must submit a project plan to the instruction team
- During project week, your team must generally work on-campus so we can help whenever your team is stuck.
- Each day, each team will to a 5-10 minute standup meeting with the instructional staff.
- Each team should engage in user testing by inviting people to sit down and interact with your site. This will help your UI/UX immensely.
- On the last day of project week, your team must present your project in front of the class, using the deployed version of the project.
- Your team's project presentation must open with each team member delivering her/his 60-second pitch, as outline in a Career Coaching assignment in Canvas.

## Project Plan

Your project plan document may be presented either on paper or electronically. Some stuff scribbled on a whiteboard, or a photo of some stuff you scribbled on a whiteboard, is not sufficient.

The project plan document should contain the following information:

- Your team's name (if you want one)
- Your team's members
- Your project's name and concept
- A diagram of your project's domain model (we'll do a sample in class)
- An exhaustive explanation of how your team plans to address details in the problem domain, ideally to the detail level of listing the data collections and functions you'll need
- Sketches/wireframes of your project's pages
- NOTE: You should not be writing any code prior to the approval of the project plan.
- TIP: Use pencil and paper to diagram and sketch. Online tools look snazzy but take some time to learn.

## Launch phase

Here are some suggestions on how to organize your team during the launch phase:

- Elect a Launch Driver who will be responsible for the following.
- Driving the coding of the initial scaffolding phase.
- Hosting the code under their GitHub account.
- The rest of the team will be Launch Navigators and responsible for the following.
- Navigating the coding of the initial scaffolding phase.
- Staying one-step ahead of the Launch Driver by researching unfamiliar technology.

**Once everyone is in agreement, here's how to launch a new project:**

- Build a basic scaffold, such as the following, from scratch as a team:
- README.md
- LICENSE
- index.html
- *(any other HTML files go at this level)*
- css/
  - reset.css
  - style.css
  - style2.css, etc.
- js/
  - app.js
  - app2.js
  - app-data.js
- images/
- .gitignore
- .eslintrc.json

Push these files to GitHub, add team members as Collaborators, everyone clones the repo (no forks needed) and get to work!

## Development phase

Now that your project is launched, here's how to organize the development efforts of your team. Your goal is to have the entire work plan for the project planned and organized, down to the finest details, before you begin any coding:

- Use GitHub Issues or a tool like waffle.io or Trello to manage and divide up the work between your team members. This planning is essential.
- Create new issues that'll take approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours (max!) to complete.
- Use labels and milestones as your team sees fit, but leave all newly created issues unassigned.
- Assign an issue to yourself when you commit to working on it.
- Each feature should be built on its own branch. Think of each of the issues above as a feature.
- Once assigned, create a branch using a following naming scheme such as the following:
- Imagine issue '#1' is titled "Add an about.html page".
- The branch name would be 1_add_about_page.
- Push the commits on your branch to GitHub regularly.
- Create a Pull Request for your branch even if you're unsure if it'll be merged into master.
- Ask someone else on your team to review the code in your Pull Request.
- If changes are required, make them on your branch and push them to GitHub for another review.
- Once satisfied, let the reviewer merge your Pull Request. Don't merge your own Pull Request.

## Presentation

On the last day of project week, your team will have 15-20 minutes to present your project in front of the class:

- Explain your project's problem domain and your team's solution.
- Explain the challenges that arose during project week and how your team overcame them.
- Each person should handle part of the presentation. More details will be coming on this as we get closer to the day of presentations.

## Grading

Your grade is based on your individual effort and your project's technical merit. There are two canvas assignments:

1. A team submission that is a Google form. Only one team member needs to do this submission and it takes only a few minutes.

2. And individual submission by each team member with answers to the following questions, completed after your team's presentation:

- Describe your individual contributions to the team and project.
- Share links to commits or Pull Requests that demonstrate your contributions.
- What are you most proud of?
- What would have done differently?
- What lessons did you learn from this experience?

## Congratulations!

Thanks for all your hard work through this course! We can't wait to see where you go with your new superpowers. :-)
