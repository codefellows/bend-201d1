# Class 15: Looking to the Future: Code 301 Preview and Project Week

<a id="top"></a>
## Today's Plan: Week 3, Friday Lecture... LAST CLASS DAY!

***The Code 301 entrance exam will be published later today. It will be due at 11:59pm on Sunday night. Allow yourself about an hour to complete it. Take your time, be methodical, and kick its butt.***

## Schedule for Today

- **9:00-10:30ish**

- Psychological Safety discussion with Brook Riggio, VP of Education
- Initial team meeting

**Lecture, Part 2: ** 

- Discussion on projects
- Review questions?



**1:00-???:** 

- Lab time. You will have an assignment to complete as a team, and then you can begin your project planning.




**Announcements**

  - Reminder: weekly surveys will go out to students today. As always, thank you for your feedback!
  - Starting at 9:00a on Monday morning is a blackout window on submitting classwork (including late assignments and any resubmissions) during Project Week. In other words, you should be **100%** focused on your project during Project Week. But for the rest of the week, do not spend energy on catching up on past assignments.
  - You'll have the weekend after project presentations to turn in any lingering late work or resubmissions. The deadline for that will be Sunday 10/15 at 11:59pm.
  - The instructional staff will go into the gradebook and "zero out" any previously unsubmitted assignments today. This is not punitive or permanent (you can still submit/resubmit!), just an administrative step to show you ongoing exactly where your grade stands if you do not submit any additional assignments or do any resubmits of previous assignments.
  - Note that during project week as you submit (or if you don't!) your daily project reports, your course grade will move up or down accordingly.

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 15 of Code 201, students will:

- Have an understanding of the fundamentals of Code 301 topics, as measured by observations from the instructional staff during class discussion.
- Have an understanding of how to successfully integrate Git and GitHub into a team code project, as measured by successful completion of the final project.

## Readings

- No readings for today! But keep in mind it is time to start getting into the habit of doing regular daily reading of tech articles, Twitter feeds, and other resources. A great time to do this: on your commute if you bus or train or whatever. And if you drive, there's podcasts! Always Be Learning!
