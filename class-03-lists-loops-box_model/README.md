#### Announcements

-  Your first quiz will be published late this afternoon and will be due before class Friday morning. A couple of things to know about the quizzes:
 	- Keep in mind that you have unlimited re-takes on the quizzes, and also that the quizzes are designed to be treated like they are open-book. It's more about what you can figure out than what you have memorized.
	- Also, note that the quizzes have two main purposes:

	 **1.** To get you to re-engage with the content in a different way, reinforcing your knowledge. 
	 
	 **2.** To help you prepare for the Code 301 entrance exam, which you will take at the end of Week 3. There is a minimum threshold you must pass on that exam (90%), and also, that exam factors into your grade in this class.

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 3 of Code 201, students will:

- Demonstrate understanding of and classify assorted control flow techniques in JavaScript including ‘for’ loops, ‘if’ and if/else’, as well as  ‘while’ and ‘do/while’ structures, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of and explain what HTML element attributes are and how to use them, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of and illustrate the CSS box model, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas

## **Code Review**

Let's take about 45-60 minutes to do our first big code review session. We're going to look at someone's code, have students read through it and explain it, take questions, and so on. Code review is an important part of professional development processes and also a key part of our learning environment in this course.
