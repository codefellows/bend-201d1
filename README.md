# Code 201: Foundations of Software Development

Welcome to Code 201! This is a class that builds on your foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and general web development, to prepare you for the deep dive of the Code 301 class.

## Introduction

The general course schedule is:

Daytime Track  | Nights & Weekends Track    | Topic
-----------|--------------|---------------
Week 1     | Week 1 and 2 | Basic HTML, CSS, & Javascript
Week 2     | Week 3 and 4 | OOP & working with the DOM
Week 3     | Week 5 and 6 | Events & working with libraries
Week 4     | Week 7 and 8 | Project Week

## Demos from class

Code demos used and/or created in class each day will be placed in to that day's respective subdirectory in this repo.  

## Assignments

Lab-time code assignments follow each class time. You can find these assignments in the `lab` subdirectories of each class directory. Assignment content will vary from day to day, depending on the topic. Some of the lab assignments will be pair programming assignments.

Instructions for completing and submitting the assignments can be found in the README files of the appropriate subdirectories.

Assignments are submitted using a professional-grade Git-flow. If you haven't done so already, it's time to get comfortable with the core Git commands. Don't worry, we'll give you step by step help as needed.

OK, let's get to it!
